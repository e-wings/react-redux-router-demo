# React Redux Demo

Another redux demo with no router: [react-redux-demo](https://github.com/e-wings/react-redux-demo)

This is a react-redux version Counter, integrated redux-router, redux-form, and based on [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp), [stylus](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus) and [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack). The internal data flow is handled with  [react-edux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) .

This starterkit does not include some fancy UI stuff but is a lightweight starting point for your next react app.
